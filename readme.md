## Setup

### Docker

Ensure that Docker is installed on your machine.
You can download and install Docker from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/get-started).

#### Using Pre-Built Docker Images from Docker Hub

1. **Download `compose_images.yml`**

   Obtain the `compose_images.yml` file from the repository.
   You can find it [here](https://github.com/TomaszKulowski/CopyCentral_Hub/blob/main/compose_images.yml).

2. **Create Environment Files**

   Create two environment files in the root directory of your project:

   - `.env.prod`: This file should contain production environment variables.
   Use the [`.env.prod.example`](https://github.com/TomaszKulowski/CopyCentral_Hub/blob/main/.env.prod-example)
   file as a reference to configure it.

   - `.env-prod.db`: This file should contain database-specific environment variables.
   Use the [`.env-prod.db.example`](https://github.com/TomaszKulowski/CopyCentral_Hub/blob/main/.env.prod.db-example)
   file as a reference to configure it.

3. **Run Docker Compose**

   Once you have the environment files in place, you can start the Docker containers with the following command:

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f compose_images.yml up
   ```

4. **Access the Application**

   After running the above command, the application should be up and running.
   You can access it by entering http://localhost in your web browser.


#### Building Docker Images Manually

If you prefer to build the Docker images yourself, follow these additional steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the project repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TomaszKulowski/CopyCentral_Hub.git
   cd CopyCentral_Hub
   ```

2. **Create Environment Files**

   Create two environment files in the root directory of your project:

   - `.env.prod`: This file should contain production environment variables.
   Use the [`.env.prod.example`](https://github.com/TomaszKulowski/CopyCentral_Hub/blob/main/.env.prod-example)
   file as a reference to configure it.

   - `.env-prod.db`: This file should contain database-specific environment variables.
   Use the [`.env-prod.db.example`](https://github.com/TomaszKulowski/CopyCentral_Hub/blob/main/.env.prod.db-example)
   file as a reference to configure it.

3. **Run Docker Compose**

   Use the compose.yml file provided in the repository to build and start the Docker containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   This command will build the Docker images from the source code and start the containers.

4. **Access the Application**

   After running the above command, the application should be up and running.
   You can access it by entering http://localhost in your web browser.


### Local Setup

   Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed before setting up the project:
      - Python 3.11 or higher

2. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TomaszKulowski/CopyCentral_Hub.git
   cd CopyCentral_Hub
   ```

3. **Create Environment Files**

   Create two environment files in the root directory of your project:

   - `.env.prod`: This file should contain production environment variables.
   Use the [`.env.prod.example`](https://github.com/TomaszKulowski/CopyCentral_Hub/blob/main/.env.prod-example)
   file as a reference to configure it.

   - `.env-prod.db`: This file should contain database-specific environment variables.
   Use the [`.env-prod.db.example`](https://github.com/TomaszKulowski/CopyCentral_Hub/blob/main/.env.prod.db-example)
   file as a reference to configure it.

4. **Install Dependencies**

   Install the necessary dependencies using the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run Development Server**

   Run the development server with:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:80
   ```

6. **Access the Application**

   After running the above command, the application should be up and running.
   You can access it by entering http://localhost in your web browser.

## Testing

Automated tests are crucial to ensure the stability and reliability of the application.
We are currently in the process of developing comprehensive test suites for CopyCentral Hub.

### Available Now

To facilitate testing, we currently provide a set of factories designed to generate fake data:

- **UserFactory**
- **CustomerFactory**
- **AdditionalAddressFactory**
- **DeviceFactory**
- **EmployeeFactory**
- **InformationFactory**
- **NotificationFactory**
- **OrderReviewFactory**
- **OrderServiceFactory**
- **RegionFactory**
- **ShortDescriptionFactory**
- **OrderFactory**
- **BrandFactory**
- **ModelFactory**
- **ServiceFactory**

These factories can be used to create instances of your models populated with synthetic data.
This setup allows for effective testing and development without the need for manual data entry.

### Data Generation Commands

To efficiently populate your database with fake data, we provide several management commands.
The `-n` option specifies the number of objects to be created.
